##  AI Tools Used

- **Perplexity AI:** Used extensively for coding help, troubleshooting, explaining programming concepts, generating Tailwind classnames, setting up config files, and guiding through deployment steps.
- **ChatGPT (OpenAI):** Used occasionally for alternative code suggestions, debugging, and copywriting. 
- **GitHub Copilot:** Assisted with autocomplete and inline code generation during hands-on coding, especially for repetitive functions and boilerplate.

## Specific Code Parts Reliant on AI-generated Prompts

### 1. Responsive Tailwind Styling
- Classnames and breakpoints (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) for all main UI components optimized with AI prompts.
- The gradient for title background and flex layouts were generated through AI recommendations.

### 2. Complex Utility Functions
- API calls using fetch with robust error handling and async/await wrappers followed pattern suggestions and fixes from Perplexity.
- Next.js image config with `remotePatterns` and environment checks was debugged and written based on Perplexity AI's step-by-step guidance.

### 3. Configuration and Deployment
- **next.config.js:** Remote domain settings for image optimization, TypeScript setup, and troubleshooting TypeScript/Image errors with actionable fix suggestions from Perplexity AI.
- **Vercel Deployment:** Instructions for pushing to GitHub, configuring environment variables, and resolving server-side exceptions in Vercel were based directly on AI-generated explanations.

### 4. Error Debugging Workflows
- Fixes for build errors (`Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string | StaticImport'`), image handling issues, and runtime deployment problems were all addressed using Perplexity AI troubleshooting prompts and its code clarity.

### 5. Coding Patterns and Best Practices
- Data-fetch logic, client/server file separation patterns, and back button navigation strategies were iteratively improved using AI-powered prompts and examples.

***

**Notes:**
- All code and configuration generated by AI tools was manually reviewed and adjusted for correctness, security, and maintainability before integration or deployment.
- Perplexity AI provided cited, reliable answers as well as step-by-step code explanations for both junior and advanced developer questions.
